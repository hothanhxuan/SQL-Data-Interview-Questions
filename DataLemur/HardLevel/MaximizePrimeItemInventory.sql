-- Amazon wants to maximize the storage capacity of its 500,000 square-foot warehouse by prioritizing a specific batch of prime items. 
-- The specific prime product batch detailed in the inventory table must be maintained.

-- So, if the prime product batch specified in the item_category column included 1 laptop and 1 side table, that would be the base batch. 
-- We could not add another laptop without also adding a side table; they come all together as a batch set.

-- After prioritizing the maximum number of prime batches, any remaining square footage will be utilized to stock non-prime batches, 
-- which also come in batch sets and cannot be separated into individual items.

-- Write a query to find the maximum number of prime and non-prime batches that can be stored in the 500,000 square feet warehouse based on the following criteria:
-- Prioritize stocking prime batches
-- After accommodating prime items, allocate any remaining space to non-prime batches
-- Output the item_type with prime_eligible first followed by not_prime, along with the maximum number of batches that can be stocked.

-- Assumptions:

-- Again, products must be stocked in batches, so we want to find the largest available quantity of prime batches, and then the largest available quantity of non-prime batches
-- Non-prime items must always be available in stock to meet customer demand, so the non-prime item count should never be zero.
-- Item count should be whole numbers (integers).
