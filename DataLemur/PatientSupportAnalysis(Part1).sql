-- UnitedHealth Group (UHG) has a program called Advocate4Me, 
--   which allows policy holders (or, members) to call an advocate and receive support for their health care needs 
--   â€“ whether that's claims and benefits support, drug coverage, pre- and post-authorisation, medical records, emergency assistance, or member portal services.

-- Write a query to find how many UHG policy holders made three, or more calls, assuming each call is identified by the case_id column.
